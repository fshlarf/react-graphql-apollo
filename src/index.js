// The module.hot.accept() isnâ€™t really necessary, 
// but makes it so that just the components changing within the app will refresh as you update them, 
// rather than refreshing the entire page. Every once in a while you may need to refresh just to reset the state of the app, 
// but generally, this leads to a quicker turnaround time.
